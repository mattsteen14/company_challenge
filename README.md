This was my attempt at recreating the example site provided 
for the Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox.
I know that the solution code is much simpler and more elegant 
but I just wanted to share this to preserve my process 
as I feel that I achieved the brief and even though 
it is not as perfect or elegant as the solution code, 
I learnt a lot through my process and that is the main thing.

I know that the nav bar is way too spaced out but I kind of like that.
Also I know that the portfolio section is not perfect.
It took a lot of jiggery pokery to get the text to do what I wanted.
I know how to fix these things through the solution code.

I added a different background and text color scheme 
that I think works quite well.

I have the solution code so I don't really need notes 
but I just hope you like what I've done as I'm happy with it.
